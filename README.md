Web client for the NoteRepo backend written with NextJS and Typescript.

NoteRepo is a collaborative effort to make access to our university course materials easier by uploading them in a central hub.

## Developer Notes

We're actively looking for contributors as we're only two engineers working on it at the moment. So if you know NextJS and optionally Typescript, feel free to submit pull requests, they're always welcome!

## Building the client

To get started, git clone the repository and cd into it.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NoteRepoLabs/note-repo-web-client.git

cd note-repo-client
```

Then install the dependencies using `npm`

```sh
npm install
```

You can run the client in development mode using the command

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Bug Reports

The client is still in its early stages, so bugs may be present. You can report any bugs you find using the `issues` tab if it's not already present and being fixed.
